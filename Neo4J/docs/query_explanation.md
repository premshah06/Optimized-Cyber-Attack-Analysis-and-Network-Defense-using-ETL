### Query 1: FTP-Patator Attack Frequency by Source Details

This query analyzes the frequency of FTP-Patator attacks originating from various source IP addresses within the network. It examines data patterns to understand how often these attacks occur and their geographic or network origin. The goal is to identify the most frequent attack sources and patterns, allowing security teams to prioritize defense strategies and implement network monitoring mechanisms to detect and mitigate such attacks in real-time. The analysis helps in understanding attack behaviors, such as repeated attempts from specific IP addresses, allowing organizations to take proactive measures against FTP-Patator attacks.

### Query 2: Attack Classification by Protocol

This query categorizes network attacks based on the protocols used, helping to identify which protocols are most commonly targeted in security incidents. By analyzing the distribution of attack types (e.g., FTP-Patator, DDoS, etc.) across different protocols (such as TCP, UDP, ICMP), the query provides insights into attack trends and vulnerabilities specific to each protocol. 

The results help security teams to focus their efforts on securing the most exploited protocols and to strengthen network defenses against specific attack methods associated with those protocols.

### Query 3: Identify Top 3 Destination IPs with Highest Traffic Count for Each Label

This query identifies the top three destination IP addresses that receive the highest amount of traffic for each attack label. It aggregates network traffic data, categorizing it by the specific attack type (label), and then ranks destination IPs based on traffic volume. 

The results provide valuable insights into which destination IPs are most targeted for different attack types, enabling network administrators to prioritize monitoring and defense efforts for these high-traffic destinations. This analysis helps in identifying potential points of vulnerability and improving overall network security.

### Query 4: Average Packet Details for Each Attack Type

This query calculates the average packet size and count for each type of attack. By analyzing network traffic associated with different attack labels (e.g., FTP-Patator, DDoS, etc.), the query computes the average number of packets and their size for each attack type. 

The results help in understanding the typical characteristics of traffic generated by various attacks, such as whether certain attacks involve larger or smaller packets on average. This information can aid in designing more efficient network defenses and identifying anomalies in packet behavior that may indicate the presence of specific attack types.

### Query 5: Top Source IP and Port by Event Count for Each Label

This query retrieves the top source IP addresses and ports associated with the highest event counts for each attack label. It aggregates network event data based on attack types (labels) and ranks source IPs and ports based on the frequency of occurrences.

The results highlight the most active source IPs and ports for each attack type, providing insights into which sources are most commonly involved in attacks. This information is critical for identifying potential attackers or compromised hosts and enables network security teams to focus their monitoring and defensive efforts on high-risk sources.
